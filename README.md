## Welcome to the sparkle.local repo for the Final project for System Administrion II!

### _For this final project our team was tasked with building a medium-sized enterprise from scratch for a client over a period of some weeks. As part of this project we demonstrate integration efforts to a client manager as a part of user acceptance testing in a series of milestones._
